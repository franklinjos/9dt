/**
 * @module DropToken
 * @description Drop Token takes place on a 4x4 grid.
 * A token is dropped along a column (labeled 0â€‘3) and said token goes to the lowest unoccupied row of the board.
 * A player wins when they have 4 tokens next to each other either along a row, in a column, or on adiagonal.
 * If the board is filled, and nobody has won then the game is a draw. Each player takes a turn,
 * starting with player 1, until the game reaches either win or draw.
 * If a player tries to put a token in a column that is already full, that results in an errorstate,
 * and the player must play again until they play a valid move.
